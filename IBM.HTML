    Before you start your interview prep for IBM, familiarize yourself with all the interview rounds that the IBM interview process entails to help you create an effective preparation strategy. <BR><BR>
    
    The IBM interview process involves the following steps.<BR>
    
    Application - In the first step, you must fill out the application for the position on the company's official website. You can also join their talent network to stay updated with the latest opportunities and stay connected with the company.
    Screening of the application - Your application is then screened by experts who decide if you should progress to the next round.<BR>
    Online assessment - The next step involves an online assessment of the candidate. This round may include one or more assessments depending on the role — Cognitive Ability Assessment, Coding Assessment, Video Assessment, and English Language Assessment. No role requires you to complete all four assessments.
    Interview/assessment center - If you clear the online assessments, you’ll be called for a personal interview which is further split into two rounds — Technical and HR.
    Please note: Due to the ongoing pandemic, all rounds of interviews are conducted online.<BR>
    
    The timeline of the interview process at IBM varies with the position and the interviewing panel. The onboarding can be extremely quick if the company is in urgent need of software engineers or developers. Generally, the interview process can extend up to two weeks or even more than a month. There is no fixed timeframe for receiving the offer letter from the company.
    
    Once your application is shortlisted, there are basically two parts to the interview process. Let’s look at what each entails. <BR>
    
    <B>Part 1 – Online Assessment</B><BR>
    The online assessment at IBM consists of topics like Quantitative Aptitude, Number Series, and English language. There are 72 questions, and the duration of this test is 100 minutes. 
    
    The English language test includes questions related to vocabulary, grammar, and comprehension. If you have a basic understanding of high school concepts, you can get through this round easily. The questions are multiple-choice and do not have any negative marking. 
    
    Candidates who qualify for this round are called for an interview usually conducted at IBM assessment centers. This round can only be cracked if you have enough practice. 
    
    Take up mock aptitude tests online to make sure you’re well prepared to get through this round. In addition, practice puzzles and other logical reasoning questions for this round. With a basic understanding of the concepts and time management skills, you can easily clear IBM’s online assessments.<BR><BR><BR>
    
    <B>Part 2 – Technical and HR Interview Rounds</B><BR><BR>
    Candidates who make the cut in the online assessments are usually invited onsite for technical and HR interview rounds. The Technical round at IBM is identical to FAANG companies (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google).<BR>
    
    To clear IBM’s technical round, you must have a strong fundamental understanding of your domain subjects. The questions in the technical interview at IBM revolve around topics such as data structures and algorithms, DBMS, OOPs, networking, and system design. <BR>
    
    We’ll talk about how you can prepare for technical and HR rounds at IBM in the following sections.<BR><BR>
    
    <B>Technical Interview Round at IBM</B><BR><BR>
    After having cleared online assessments, the next rounds of interviews are Technical and HR rounds. When preparing for these rounds, spend some time researching IBM and what the company is all about. Your interviewers will also expect you to have knowledge about the area you want to work in. <BR>
    
    The Technical Interview round may either be conducted over the phone, video, or in-person. In case you are invited to IBM’s assessment center, you can expect a few group exercises as well as a possibility of an in-person interview. These rounds are great for you to interview the interviewers. IBMers would expect and appreciate you asking them many questions about their company and the position you’re applying for.<BR><BR>
