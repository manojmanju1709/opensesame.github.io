     <h2>Salesforce Recrutiment  Process</h2><br><br>
     <p><b>Round 1: Online Round (Hosted on Hackerrank | Duration: 1 hour)</b><br><br><br>

➸ The online round consists of 10 MCQs and 2 coding questions.<br>

➸ MCQs were asked from Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems and DBMS. They were of easy complexity. (+1 for a correct answer and -0.25 for an incorrect answer)<br>

➸ The coding questions were similar to the following two problems:<br>
a) Palindrome by swapping only one character<br>

b) Find the number of days between two dates<br>

➸ Both problems were of 10 marks each and consisted of 4 test cases (each of 2.5 marks)<br>

➸ 14 students were shortlisted after this round.<br><br>

<b>Round 2:-First Technical Interview (around 1 hour)</b><br><br><br>

➸ A quick introduction and basic CV based questions.<br>

➸ Some of the problems asked were similar to the following problems.<br>

a) Given a sorted array (sorted in non-decreasing order) of positive numbers, find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as a sum of elements of any subset of given set.<br>




b) Consider a matrix with rows and columns, where each cell contains either a ‘0’ or a ‘1’ and any cell containing a 1 is called a filled cell. <br>
Two cells are said to be connected if they are adjacent to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.<br>
 If one or more filled cells are also connected, they form a region.<br>
 find the length of the largest region.<br> 

c) Another problem similar to m coloring problem<br>

d) Convert a binary tree to DLL <br>
You can be asked to write fully executable code on the sheet as well.<br>

➸ 9 students were shortlisted for the next round.<br><br>

<b>Round 3:- Second Technical Interview </b>(around 1.5 hours)<br><br><br>

➸ This interview was entirely based on System Design, OOPS Concepts and some were asked questions on OS ( Virtual Memory, Thrashing, LRU etc.).<br>

➸ Some System Design problems that were being asked were Uber Pool, Swiggy, Banking System that inputs a list of transactions and tells top 5 customers at any point in an optimized way.<br>

➸ Try to make this interview as interactive as possible by constantly engaging the interviewer as you go along with the problem, discuss with him/her how you are approaching towards the solution and share your thought process as well.<br>

➸ They might ask you to write the class/data structure with proper variables and some functions as well.<br><br>

<b>Round 4:-HR Round</b><br><br><br>

➸ This was a quick round of hardly 5-10 minutes interaction and very basic questions.<br>
➸ Only 4 students were called for this round.<br>

➸ Only those 4 were selected finally.<br><br>
