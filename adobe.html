     <h2>The Tech Interview Process at Adobe</h2><br><br>
     <p>Adobe recruits candidates at all levels. New graduates are hired through campus recruitment drives or traditional off-campus channels. 
         Experienced professionals can apply through the company’s career portal. <br><br>
         Following are the main stages of the Adobe interview process:<br><br>
         1.<b> Application Process</b><br><br>
         Adobe has specific criteria to shortlist applicants. You should:<br><br>
         ✨ Have a strong background in computer science, and strong problem-solving skills are preferred.<br><br> 
         ✨ Be passionate about coding <br><br>
         ✨ Have proven practical experience<br><br>
         2. <b>Adobe Online Coding Interview </b><br><br>
         Adobe uses coding sites such as ‘HackerRank’ and ‘CodinGame’ to conduct online coding exams. 
         Candidates must showcase their programming capabilities by obtaining the desired results.<br><br>
         3. <b>Phone Screen </b><br><br>
         During the phone screen discussion, you will learn about the company and the position you’ve applied for.
          Recruiters will ask you a few questions to understand your work experience, tech knowledge, and skills.<br><br>
        4. <b> Tech Phone Screen With a Recruiting Manager</b><br><br>
        Next, you’ll have a discussion with a recruiting manager. 
        Your resume will be discussed in detail, and you’ll be evaluated for problem-solving skills, leadership abilities, and culture fit.<br><br>
        5. <b>Technical Assessment</b><br><br>
        If you clear the phone screen, you’ll be sent a link to an online technical assessment, 
        consisting of approximately 65 questions divided into two sections:<br><br>
        <b>Aptitude and Logic (45 questions, 45 minutes):</b> To test your quantitative and logic-based reasoning skills. <br><br>
        <b>Technical and Coding (15-20 questions, 75-120 mins):</b> To test your data structures, algorithms, and bit manipulation skills. 
        You can take the test in any language, but C, C++, and Java are Adobe’s preferred languages. <br><br>
        6. <b>On-site Interview</b><br><br>
        Due to the pandemic, on-site interviews may be conducted remotely. 
        The on-site interviews comprise four rounds of technical interviews and one HR interview. <br><br>
        There are two tech interviews:<br><br>
        ⭐ System Design Interview<br><br>
        ⭐ Object-Oriented Design Interview<br><br>
        You will have to code using a whiteboard during these interviews, 
        and you’ll be required to describe your thought process and why you chose a particular programming language to arrive at your solution.<br><br>
        7. <b>HR Interview</b><br><br>
        During this round, you’ll be evaluated on your core values and your work dynamics through behavioral and situational questions. <br><br>
