     <p><h2>THE Twitter Interview Process</h2><br><br>
Stages of the Twitter Tech Interview Process
Twitter’s technical interview typically consists of these four steps:-<br>

<b>Phone Screen:-</b><br>
✎ After your resume gets shortlisted for the specific job role, the phone screen will be the first round you go through.<br>
✎ This round is quite casual because this is where the recruiters get to know you as a candidate for the first time.<br>

✎ Here, the recruiter will ask your reason for applying at Twitter, your previous experience regarding the particular job role, and your opinion on how much value you would be adding to the company.<br>

✎ For this round, it is mandatory to know about the history and vision of the company beforehand. Go through Twitter’s About Us, Company, and Values pages to get more information on the company.<br>

<b>Online Coding Test:-</br></b>
✎ For the second round, make sure you are well-versed in the programming languages required for the particular job role. Typically, this round consists of 2 questions. Since practice makes perfect, you can practice extensively beforehand to get the timing right during the technical interview.<br>

<b>Technical Phone Screen:-</b><br>
