Dilpreet wants to paint his dog's home that 
has n boards with different lengths. The 
length of ith board is given by arr[i] where 
arr[] is an array of n integers. He hired k painters 
for this work and each painter takes 1 unit time 
to paint 1 unit of the board. 

The problem is to find the minimum time to get this 
job done if all painters start together with the 
constraint that any painter will only paint continuous 
boards, say boards numbered {2,3,4} or only board {1} 
or nothing but not boards {2,4,5}.


Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
k = 3
arr[] = {5,10,30,20,15}
Output: 35
Explanation: The most optimal way will be:
Painter 1 allocation : {5,10}
Painter 2 allocation : {30}
Painter 3 allocation : {20,15}
Job will be done when all painters finish
i.e. at time = max(5+10, 30, 20+15) = 35
Example 2:

Input:
n = 4
k = 2
arr[] = {10,20,30,40}
Output: 60
Explanation: The most optimal way to paint:
Painter 1 allocation : {10,20,30}
Painter 2 allocation : {40}
Job will be complete at time = 60

Your task:
Your task is to complete the function 
minTime() which takes the integers n 
and k and the array arr[] as input and 
returns the minimum time required to 
paint all partitions.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n log m) , m = sum of all boards' length
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ k ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105</pre>
