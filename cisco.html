     <h2>Cisco Interview Process</h2><br><br>
     <p>
         <b>Selection Process</b><br><br>
         In case of job recruitment, selection is the process to choose potential working persons for a company or organization.
          Recruitment process includes a selection stage when decisions are made as to the viability of a particular candidate's job application.
           It directly affects the overall productivity of an organization. A right selection may increase the overall performance of a 
           company & a wrong one may lead to material and financial loss. A perfect selection process can help to pick the most eligible 
           candidates amongst all applicants. 
         The Process of selecting candidates focuses on abilities, knowledge, skills, experience and various other related factors.<br><br>
         <b>Academic Criteria</b><br><br>
         ⭐ Minimum CSPA 8.5 or higher<br><br>
         ⭐ No backlogs should be there.<br><br>
         <b>Technical Interview</b><br><br>
         Questions related to specific technical fields are asked in this round. Questions may be based on specific knowledge about the company's 
         technical activities; understanding of the technical work required to be completed
         as part of the job applied for or may enquire candidates to solve actual technical problems that
          they would be likely to face if employed.<br><br>
          <b>Managerial Interview</b><br><br>
          Managerial Interview is much different from entry-level job interviews. Instead of asking you about your skills, 
          the hiring manager will address a number of different competencies. 
          This helps the hiring manager understand how you'll think and act in tough management situations.<br><br>
          <b>HR Interview</b><br><br>
          Final step to select a candidate as an employee is Interview as it helps to determine a candidate's personality. 
          Questions can be of wide range starting from your introduction, Qualification, Experience,
           Industry specific experience, Courses done, your strengths and weaknesses, salary expectations, friends, family etc.<br><br>

          because the main focus is what you know and what is the scope in which they can ask questions.So prepare your resume at your best!<br><br>
