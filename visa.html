     <p><h2>The Visa Interview Process</h2><br><br>

<b>Round 1 (Coding Round):</b><br> 
✦ Round 1 was the coding round conducted on the Hackerrank platform.<br> 
✦ There were 2 coding questions to be solved in 60 minutes.<br>  

✦ There are different images given as array and their corresponding frame numbers in another array.<br>
✦ Images are to be arranged in order according to their frame numbers.<br>
✦ Find Perfect substring: String s comprised of numbers from 0 to 9.<br> 
✦ Find a Perfect string if all elements within a string occur exactly k times.<br> 
✦ Calculate the number of perfect strings in s.<br>
✦ if one solves one and a half or both the questions, you get shortlisted for the next round. <br>
✦ It's time to become a success story instead of reading them.<br>

✦ 13 students were shortlisted in this round.<br>




<b>Round 2 (Technical Round):-</b><br> 
✦ The interview was conducted on Microsoft Teams.<br> 
✦ All the interviewers were really frank and made me feel super comfortable.<br> 
It started with my introduction, followed by the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, DBMS, OS, and Networking. They might ask some puzzle questions if time permits. He asked me if I like networking or not. I very openly said that I am not very comfortable with this subject. In OOP he asked:<br>

✦ What are the classes?<br>
✦ Difference between function overloading and overriding<br>
✦ Some basics of inheritance<br>
✦ Virtual functions<br>
✦ In DBMS, he focused on the theory (Normal Forms, a transaction in DBMS, and ACID properties). I could not recall some points, so I asked if he could ask some query related questions instead. The problems were solvable.<br>

✦ In OS, he asked the difference between process and thread.<br> 
✦ In networking, he asked about different OSI layers and their functions.<br>

✦ He moved to the coding question which was conducted on the HackerRank Code-pair platform.<br>
✦ It was a simple stack question of balancing the brackets from GFG.<br>

✦ 9 students were shortlisted for the next round.<br>

<b>Round 3 (Technical + HR Round):-</b><br> 
✦ It also started with my introduction and that of the interviewer.<br> 
✦ The interviewer focused on the resume and asked me a quite interesting question<br>
✦ Suppose you are the CEO of a newly launched e-commerce company.<br> 
✦ What one new thing would you introduce in your company which is not there at Amazon.<br>  
✦ We had a lot of healthy discussion on this question.<br> 
✦ Basically, they want to judge your ability to think out-of-the-box.<br>

✦ Then he moved to the coding questions.<br> 
✦ He asked the logic for a 2-D matrix and array question which I am unable to recall.<br>  

✦ 7 students were shortlisted for the next round.<br>

<b>Round 4 (HR Round):-</b><br> 
✦ It was the final round and was with one of the senior members.<br> 
✦ It was a very interactive round including questions about family, hometown, and the company.<br> 
✦ The interviewer told about the work at Visa.<br> 
✦ He asked the questions from Resume.<br> 
✦ Based on the resume he will ask some questions<br> 
✦ He asked about the real-time applications of these technologies.<br> 
✦ He gave me some problems to solve with the type of data they use at Visa. <br> 

✦ 5 students were selected <br>

<b>Tip:-</b><br> 
✦ The process of the interview at Visa is quite interactive and different from the others.<br> 
✦ Your resume should be very precise.<br> 
✦ You should know every bit of your resume.<br> 
✦ Brush up your theoretical concepts of DBMS, Networking, OOP, OS before the interview.<br> 
✦ Know everything about your projects.<br> 
✦ They might also get satisfied with your logic (in programming questions), so at least tell the logic if unable to code. Having good communication skills and creativity would be a great help. In the last round be prepared with any kind of question including why should we hire you, why should we not hire you, strengths, weaknesses, etc.  <br>
