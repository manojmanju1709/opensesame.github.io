     <h2>The Amazon Interview Process </h2><br><br>
     <p>The basic eight-step interview process at Amazon is as follows:<br><br>
        1.<b> HR email or call</b><br>
        The first step of the Amazon interview process is when a recruiter contacts you via email, call, or LinkedIn. 
        At this point, they'll ask for your resume. So have one prepared.<br><br>
        2. <b>Online assessment</b><br>
        Online or take-home assessments are mostly for internship and new graduate positions. However, Amazon sometimes uses online assessments for experienced job roles as well. 
        The organization gives three different online assessments before progressing to the phone screening stage.
         The different types of online assessments are:<br><br>
         ⭐ The first online assessment consists of 7 Debugging questions. You need to solve them in 20  mins.<br>
         ⭐  The second online assessment consists of 2 coding questions. You need to solve them in 70 mins.<br>
         ⭐ The third online assessment has two parts. The first part is work stimulation and usually takes two hours. The second part is logical reasoning. <br>
         ⭐ It has 24 questions that you need to solve in 35 mins. <br><br>
         3.<b>Phone screening</b><br><br>
         This lasts about 45 minutes to 1 hour.  A typical phone screening round is where the recruiter will assess your interest and fit for the role.
          He/she will also ask basic questions about your background and work experience. <br><br>
          4.<b>Video interviews</b><br><br>
          If you pass the phone screening round, you'll be invited for a video interview. This interview lasts for about 45 to 60 minutes. 
          It will involve a hiring manager or a peer of the same level as your role. They will ask more in-depth questions about your resume. 
          Be prepared to answer coding and system design questions. You'll also be asked behavioral questions and relevant experience you have for the job.
           You should use this meeting as a chance to learn as much as possible about the job. <br><br>
           5. <b>Final “Loop” Interview</b><br><br>
           Amazon will invite you for an onsite interview, also known as a “Loop”, once you clear the video interview round. 
           Due to the current stay-at-home orders, all loop interviews are conducted virtually. Loop interviews are anywhere from two to nine interview rounds, usually in succession. 
           The number of interviewers depends on the level of the position. 
           For example, a Level 5 (L5) position would have five total interviewers; an L7 would have seven, and so on. <br><br>
           Your interviewers will also comprise a senior member called a “bar raiser.” He/she will be a more senior interviewer and have at least 4+ years of experience.
            A bar raiser is an Amazon employee who is trained to be an interview expert. You will not know who they are. They serve as a mediator for a bias-free hiring decision.
            Their job is to determine whether you will “raise the bar” if you join the organization. <br><br>
            <b>The bar raiser will focus on the following:</b><br><br>
            ✨ What type of questions is the candidate asking?<br>
            ✨ Does the candidate ﬁt with Amazon’s leadership principles?<br>
            ✨ Does the candidate see the bigger picture of the product or the role?<br>
            ✨ Is the candidate customer-centric?<br><br>
            The final loop interview is typically more difﬁcult. We recommend that you prepare yourself for an hour-long intense conversation with some of the brightest minds.
             If you are exhausted, then it is probably best to reschedule the interview when you are feeling 100% alert and focused.<br><br>
             6. <b>Hiring Meeting</b><br><br>
             Behind the scenes, a hiring committee decides on an offer or no offer and collectively sets your level (which dictates your salary range). Usually, you will know the result within one week of ﬁnishing ﬁnal interviews.
              There’s not much you can do at this stage, but if you haven’t already, deﬁnitely send a thank you note to the people you have met. <br><br>
            7.<b>Reference Check</b><br><br>
            A reference or background check generally involves contacting a candidate's former employers, mentors, co-workers, and educators. 
            The goal is to obtain information about the candidate's knowledge, skills, abilities, and character. 
            If you apply for a position above L5 at Amazon, you will have to provide one or two reference checks, sometimes more for senior roles. 
            These checks are conducted by the HR manager or hiring manager over the phone and last about 15-20 minutes.<br><br>
            8.<b>Offer rollout</b><br><br>
            If everything goes well, the recruiter will give you an offer, usually within a day or two of the reference check. 
            However, it can sometimes take longer. If you choose to negotiate, a separate compensation committee will approve the adjustments.
             The recruiter will send over the necessary paperwork if everything is cleared. <br><br>
