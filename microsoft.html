     <h2>Microsoft Interview Process</h2><br><br>
     The interview process typically consists of 3-4 rounds of interviews.<br><br>
     <p>1. <b>Initial phone screen with the recruiter:</b><br><br>
        A recruiter from human resources will get in touch with you after shortlisting your profile based on the role’s requirements. You’ll be asked elementary questions about your experience, skills, and core capabilities.
         Upon passing the initial phone screen, typically by meeting the role’s requirements, 
         you’ll be invited to the preliminary coding round. <br><br>
         2. <b>The Phone screen interview </b><br><br>
         This will involve writing code on a document shared by you and the interviewer.
          Problems presented in this section can be solved quickly and are relatively straightforward. 
         To effectively solve these questions you should have a strong understanding of the fundamentals of algorithms and data structures.<br><br>
        3.<b>The Microsoft on-site interview </b><br><br>
        The real test of your abilities happens at the on-site interview. 
        You’ll be asked to come on-site to the Microsoft office and meet with interviewers in person. 
        The on-site interviews usually comprise 3-4 rounds and may last the entire day.
        If the on-site interviews go well, you’re more likely to be extended an offer. <br><br>
        4. <b>HR round and salary negotiations</b><br><br>
        The final negotiations of your offer occur in this round. 
        You are free to ask any questions relevant to your profile, your compensation, and the general culture of the company.<br>
