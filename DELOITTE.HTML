                    ✨Group Discussion / Just a Minute (JAM)<BR>
                        ✨Technical + HR Round<BR><Br>

    ✨60 percent or above in B.Tech, Class X and XII.<Br>
        ✨No backlogs at the time of interview<BR><BR>
<B>Online Round :</B><BR><Br>
Online round oftenly consists mainly of four sections namely, General Aptitude, logical, Probability and Statistics and verbal sections. To be prepared for aptitude section you can practice from our Placement Section.<BR><Br>

<B>Group Discussion / Just a Minute Round:</B><BR><BR>
The students who clear the online round are called for Group Discussion Round. In this round they check your communication and presentation skills. Deloitte oftenly provides a case study based on a Technical problem faced by an organization. You would have 5 minutes to read it and then discuss it for another 15 minutes. Sometimes, you could also be asked to prepare charts in groups. Deloitte moderators could also ask questions based on your solution. Sometimes, they provide you a minute to put your points instead of group discussion.<BR><br>

<B>NOTE</B><BR>

    ✨Do not pause, do not repeat the same sentences you’ve used. They check your communication and presentation skills. Confidence is the key here!<BR>
        ✨Read the case study carefully and understand the objective carefully.<BR>
            ✨Try to mention/build upon points put forth by fellow group members while moving the discussion forward, this shows that you were carefully listening to what others were saying.<BR>
                ✨Fluency in English, though is important but is not an eliminating factor. Make good points.<BR>
                    ✨Do not interrupt, but immediately start speaking as and when someone completes otherwise you won’t get opportunity to speak.<BR>
                        ✨In the case study round, don’t dominate (those who did, got rejected). Give everybody a chance to speak.<BR>
                            ✨If someone is silent, politely ask him to pour in ideas into the group. This will show that you are a good leader.<BR><BR>
<B>Technical + HR Round</B><BR><BR>
The students who clear the online round are called for this Round. They could also conduct these rounds separately. To clear technical problems, you should be prepared with Operating Systems, Computer Networks and database. Students will be expected to write codes in the interview.
