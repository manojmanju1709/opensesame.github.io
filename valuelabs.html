    <p> <h2>Valuelabs Recruitment Process</h2><br><br>
valuelabs follows  4-5 rounds like:-<br>     
✔ Online Written-test<br>
✔ Group Discussion<br>
✔ Technical Round – (L1 and L2)<br>
✔ HR Round<br><br><br><br>
✔ Online Written-test Written test was of 90 minutes divided into 5 sections including verbal, aptitude, logical, reasoning, technical (concentrate more on C pseudo-codes), coding ( 1 question related to pattern printing was given). All sections were easy but the time factor was the major issue. Knowing the tricks to crack the questions is not enough, practice is essential.<br><br>
✔ After the online test, we had a presentation talk from ValueLabs people.<br><br> 
✔ They took about an hour, explained to us what they do, what kind of technologies they use, followed by a small Q&A round.<br><br>
✔ Then the results of the online test were announced.<br> <br>
✔ Around 300 students appeared for the online test.<br> <br>
✔ 50 were shortlisted for the next round.<br><br> 
✔ The students who successfully cleared coding were moved to technical round directly and the remaining who gave their best in the rest of the sections were given a chance to go through the group discussion round.<br><br><br>
<b>Group Discussion:-</b> The next was group discussion which was about 20- 25 minutes. <br><br>
✔ 50 were divided into 5 groups. <br><br>
✔ Each group had different topics to discuss.<br><br>
✔ Most of the topics were based on trending technologies.<br><br>
✔ Our group was asked to speak our minds on “Internet of Things”.<br><br> 
✔ 2 minutes of time was given for preparation.<br><br> 
✔ I noted down a few points which came across my mind in a paper and spoke that out when I got a chance. Talk only valid points with a real-time example and future scope that would impress them.<br><br>
✔ Out of 50, around 25 made it to the next round.<br> <br>
✔ The next round is technical which consists of two rounds- L1 and L2 interviews.<br><br><br>
<b>Technical Round – (L1 and L2)</b>: L1 interview was of 30 minutes for me (depends on the interviewer).<br> 
✔ I was asked to tell about myself.<br> <br>
✔ He asked me to explain about my internship (questions related to cybersecurity was asked as I’m a Cyber Security Intern) and project.<br><br> 
✔ He also asked me to write some simple programs.<br><br>
✔ I will mention some of the questions that I remember.<br><br>
✔ Swapping of 2 integers without using third variable.<br><br>
✔ Registration form using HTML and CSS.<br><br>
✔ Find the second largest number in a given array.<br><br>
✔ Out of 25, 11 were moved to the next round.<br><br>
✔ The next was the L2 interview (via Skype – it was about 15 minutes for me and again it depends on the interviewer). <br><br>
✔ Again I was asked to introduce myself.<br><br>
✔ Questions related to my hobbies ( I’m fond of making posters so we had a funny discussion regarding posters) and projects were asked.<br><br> 
✔ He asked me to explain OOPS concepts with examples and to write a code to find the sum of 100 integers (as we were on Skype, I wrote the code in the chat terminal).<br><br>
✔ That’s the end of the round and if you have any questions to ask, you can proceed.<br><br>
<b>HR ROUND:- </b>Once you crack the above rounds, then you’re almost done.<br> 
✔ The next is the HR round which was for formality.<br><br>
✔ The results were declared on the spot and finally, 8 students were selected.<br><br>
