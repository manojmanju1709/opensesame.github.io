    <h2>What Is the Apple Interview Process Like?</h2><br><br>
<p>
    To land a job at Apple, you need to be familiar with their interview process. 
    You can expect up to 9-12 rounds of interviews before bagging an offer. 
    Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the Apple interview process:<br><br>
    1. <b>Phone Screen</b><br><br>
    There can be up to 2 phone screen rounds. It will be a 30-minute informal conversation with a recruiter,
     who will assess your interest in Apple and the role and how well you will fit in the team. 
    The first call will be with an internal recruiter, but the second call might be with a team lead since all the openings at Apple are team-specific. 
    You will be asked questions on your academic qualifications, professional achievements, and your past projects.<br><br>
    2. <b>FaceTime interview</b><br><br>
    This is a unique round that takes place in an Apple interview process. There can be up to 5 FaceTime interviews. 
    These will be one-on-one interviews, which last roughly 30 minutes each. In this round, you will be assessed on your technical as well as behavioral skills. 
    Few of these questions will require a lot of introspection.<br><br>
    3. <b>Technical Assessment</b><br><br>
    The technical phone screen will be with a hiring manager or a team lead from the team you will be joining.
     In this interview, you will be judged on your resume and a few questions around data structure and algorithms. 
     You will have to use a tool called Codility, a shared editor, to solve the coding questions.
     These take 45-60 minutes, and you will have 30 minutes to code.<br><br>
     4. <b>Onsite Interview</b><br><br>
     After the two phone screens, you will face the onsite or virtual onsite interview. The invitation for this interview might take up to 2 weeks.
      Here, you will be judged on your domain knowledge and other skills like passion and patience. It can last up to 6 hours, where around 8-12 people will interview you. 
      In some cases, the number also might go up to 15.
      The onsite interviews will be a combination of behavioral, domain knowledge, and coding questions.<br><br>
      These interviews will last up to 45-60 minutes each. You can also have two people interviewing you at the same time. 
      So, be prepared to be cross-questioned by the second interviewer while you are still writing the code.
       They might also bomb you with many questions like a rapid-fire round to judge your patience and focus. 
      Stay calm and understand the question well before answering.<br><br>
