Given N Magnets which are placed linearly, with each magnet 
to be considered as of point object. Each magnet suffers force 
from its left sided magnets such that they repel it to the right 
and vice versa. All forces are repulsive. The force being equal 
to the distance (1/d , d being the distance). Now given the 
positions of the magnets, the task to find all the points 
along the linear line where net force is ZERO. 

More Formally, Magnets are placed on X axis, the coordinates of 
which are given, you are asked to find out the X-co-ordinates of 
all the equilibrium points (i.e. the point where net force is zero). 
You notice the point each magnet repels each other, it means the 
polarity of the magnet is such that exerts +ve force in its right 
side and -ve force in left side, (here +ve is considered in +ve 
direction of x-axis). And that forces are inversely proportional 
to the distance, thus there lies an equilibrium point between every 
two magnetic points. Thus there will be total of N-1 equllibrium 
points. You have to find those N-1 points.
Note: Array M[] is sorted and distance have to be calculated 
with precision of 2 decimal places.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
M[] = {1, 2}
Output:
1.50
Explanation:
The mid point of two points will have 
net force zero, thus answer = 1.50
 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
M[] = {0, 10, 20, 30}
Output:
3.82, 15.00, 26.18
 

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your 
task is to complete the function nullPoints() which 
takes the array M[], its size N as inputs and an answer 
array getAnswer[] to store the points having net force 
zero till precised two decimal places.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N2 * Log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
2 ≤ N ≤ 105
0 ≤  M[1] < ....M[i] < M[i+1] < ....M[N] ≤ 106
