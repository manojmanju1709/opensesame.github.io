     <h2>Interview Experiences of Netflix Employees</h2><br><br>
     <p>
        To get an understanding of actual interview experiences at Netflix, we examined Paul Johnson, 
        former director of engineering, on how his interview went.<br><br>
        “When I was interviewing with Netflix, it was long-winded and irritating. I was on the verge of walking away from the process twice.
         Since I've joined, as a manager, I've found it's actually well organized, swift, and successful.<br><br>
         I was contacted on LinkedIn by a recruiter. He e-mailed me the job spec (this was for Automation Manager) and asked me if I was interested.
          I told him I wasn't since the job was probably a bit too junior for me. He came back to me with a revised job spec for Senior Automation Manager with additional responsibilities.
          Now I was interested, so he arranged a phone interview with a different recruiter.”<br><br>
          1. <b>First Phone Screen</b><br><br>
          “The first phone screen was a breeze. Asking me about my experience, what I was looking for in my career etc. 
          Nothing difficult.<br><br>
          That leads to a second phone interview, this time with the hiring manager.
           That was a more in-depth look at my experience to date, discussions of similar projects I'd been involved with 
           (they were primarily looking to hire me to install a bunch of machines to automate the processing of DVDs that are returned from customers).
           We talked about his prior career and experience as well. It was a good call, and I liked him from the start.
            He was someone I could work with.”<br><br>
            2. <b>Face-to-Face with Recruiter and Hiring Manager</b><br><br>
            “Next, they arranged a face to face with the second recruiter and the hiring manager back to back.<br><br>
            The interview with the recruiter did not go well. I disliked him immediately, and I've subsequently found that the length of the overall process I faced was as a result of him not liking me either.
             We talked about my experiences as a manager and the Netflix culture deck. He was very pleased with the culture deck, but clearly had no understanding of what applying it actually meant.
              He seemed to think it was impressive because other people outside of Netflix say it sounds great. He was very hung up on "Netflix only tolerate fully formed adults", yet as a relatively inexperienced person in his mid-20's,
             he had no idea about the complexities of adult life and the challenges that can bring. 
             I'm pleased to say he's no longer on Netflix.”<br><br>
             3. <b> Interview with Hiring Manager</b><br><br>
             “I then met with the hiring manager, and it was great. We got on immediately (well after he'd stopped laughing at me for wearing a suit.
              I'd asked for a look at the production facilities and the equipment I'd be working on, so they arranged that, 
              where I again briefly met the hiring manager and had an interview with an HR Manager. 
             The HR Manager was great. I discussed my misgivings based on my discussion with the recruiter, and he put my mind at ease.<br><br>
            4. <b>Interview with VP of HR</b><br><br>
            “I was now expecting an offerInstead,  I was asked to go in for an interview with Allison Hopkins, who was VP of HR. 
            That was a great interview.
            We again discussed my experience, ideas about management, and my goals in life. 
            She was great, again, making me want to work at Netflix. I like her a lot, and it's a cause of sadness that she is no longer with Netflix.”<br><br>
            5. <b>Interview with Head of the DVD Division</b><br><br>
            “I was now expecting an offer.Instead, I was asked to go in for an interview with the head of the DVD division. 
            Another fun interview, we talked about the hiring manager a lot, who then came and joined us,
            and Andy and John (the hiring manager) somehow ended up debating which swearwords are and are not appropriate at an interview.
            I didn't offer much to that part of the interview. It was entertaining.”<br><br>
            6. <b>Dinner with Hiring Manager</b><br><br>
            “I was now expecting an offer and getting irritated that it seemed like they were wasting my time.
            Instead, I got invited to have dinner with the hiring manager. 
            I was in two minds about saying no, because the process had taken so long, and I was beginning to question their seriousness. 
            The dinner was awkward. John is a fairly reserved man (now a valued friend however, I met him for a beer in the same place we had the dinner last week and we had a laugh about it), 
            and it felt like an uncomfortable first date. 
            There was little to discuss - he knew what I had done, could do, etc.”<br><br>
            7. <b>Offer Given</b><br><br>
            “I now decided that if an offer didn't come within the week, I'd pull out of consideration. 
            Fortunately one did, and I've now been at Netflix approaching four years.
            When I talked to the hiring manager about that dinner, he told me that the reason the whole process ended up taking too long was because of the recruiter who didn't like me.
             Normally, we have a process whereby anyone can
            "veto" a candidate, but the disparity between John's opinion of me after the first face to face and the recruiters was so great, that John wasn't willing to stop talking to me. 
            However, it did lead to everyone wanting to meet me to make sure it was John who was right.”<br>
