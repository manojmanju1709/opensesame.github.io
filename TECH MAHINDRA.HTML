            For writing an essay, some of the useful points can be found below.  <BR>
            
            <B>Prepare For Free With Conduira's Job Prep Programme</B><BR><BR>
            Text is prose:<BR>
            Spelling and Punctuation should be taken care of while writing the essay. The fundamental question should be: What am I attempting to express? And the answer is the text. Being lucid and absolute are the hallmarks of a good text. Short sentences indicate tension. Longer sentences, on the other hand, indicate a frantic need to finish off the writing!<BR><BR>
            
            <B>Words are NECESSARY:</B><BR><BR>
            Expand vocabulary to make writing more spot-on. This is to not to say that one “flaunts” vocabulary, but having more “tools” will allow one to select the most appropriate “tool” for the job. So pick one new word each day, and then use it many times in the conversations with others that day. You can use vocab prep in Conduira Online to improve vocabulary.  <BR><BR>
            
            <B>Avoid nonsense:</B><BR><BR>
            No nonsense. Don't force a reader to spend 20 minutes when the idea can be conveyed in 5 minutes. <BR>
            
            More editing. Write once and edit umpteen times. Each time look for compactness in the text. If one is in doubt, remove certain parts of the text to check if the moot of the issue suffers. If that is not, then just remove.<BR><BR>
            
            <B>Creation of Interest:</B><BR><BR>
             Every sentence must serve a purpose: The first sentence must make the reader want to read the second. The second sentence must propel the reader to the third. If a sentence doesn’t move the narrative forward— then it is the end of the writing.<BR><BR>
            
            Avoid too many adverbs:<BR>
            A sure sign of amateur writing is the overuse of adverbs, especially -ly adverbs. A woman in a story isn’t incredibly pretty—she’s beautiful; the sky isn’t very blue—it’s azure. Find the right words to avoid using adverbs."<BR><Br>
            
            Write daily during the placement season. If one wants to improve writing, write every day—make it a daily habit so that by the time you sit for placements, you are accustomed to it. <BR><BR>
            
            <B>Tech Mahindra Technical Round:</B><BR><Br>
            In the technical round, some of the subjects you will be tested include C, C++, JAVA, and SQL. Along with them, prepare on two more subjects from your branch. In most of the technical interviews, the interview panel will ask your favorite subject – in the case of which you can speak out the subjects you have prepared. You will be getting questions from the summer project as well as final year project as well. <BR><BR>
