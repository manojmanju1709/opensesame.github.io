			<pre>
You are given N number of books. Every ith book 
has Ai number of pages. 
You have to allocate contagious books to M number 
of students. There can be many ways or permutations 
to do so. In each permutation, one of the M students 
will be allocated the maximum number of pages. Out 
of all these permutations, the task is to find that 
particular permutation in which the maximum number 
of pages allocated to a student is minimum of those 
in all the other permutations and print this minimum value. 

Each book will be allocated to exactly one student. Each 
student has to be allocated at least one book.

Note: Return -1 if a valid assignment is not possible, 
and allotment should be in contiguous order (see the 
explanation for better understanding).


Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
A[] = {12,34,67,90}
M = 2
Output:
113
Explanation: 
Allocation can be done in following ways:
{12} and {34, 67, 90} Maximum Pages = 191
{12, 34} and {67, 90} Maximum Pages = 157
{12, 34, 67} and {90}  Maximum Pages =113
Therefore, the minimum of these cases is 
113, which is selected as the output.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 3
A[] = {15,17,20}
M = 2
Output:
32
Explanation:
Allocation is done as 
{15,17} and {20}

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your 
task is to complete the function findPages() which 
takes 2 Integers N, and m and an array A[] of length 
N as input and returns the expected answer.


Expected Time Complexity: O(NlogN)
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A [ i ] <= 106
1 <= M <= 105</pre>
