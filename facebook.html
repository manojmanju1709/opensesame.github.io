     <p>Nailing interviews at FAANG companies, especially Facebook, is not easy.
          According to Gayle McDowell,<br> author of “Cracking the Coding Interview” a
          candidate at Facebook is evaluated relative to other candidates, who are asked the same questions.
           And performance in each round counts. </p><br>
    <p>
        You know what that means — solving a problem is not enough; <br>
        you have to solve it better than the others!
    </p><br>
    <p>
        We’ll answer some of the nagging questions you might have about <br>
        Facebook’s hiring process:
    </p><br>
    <p>
        1. Am I Qualified for Tech Roles at Facebook?<br>
        2. How Do I Make My Resume Stand Out?<br>
        3. What’s the Facebook Interview Process Like?<br>
        4. What Questions Should I Expect in a Facebook Interview?<br>
        5. What Qualities Does Facebook Look for in Candidates?<br>
        6. How Do I Prepare for a Facebook Interview?<br>
    </p><br>
    <h2>Am I Qualified for Tech Roles at Facebook?</h2><br>
    <p>Tech roles at Facebook require a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or an equivalent combination of education. 
        Prior work experience will also be a factor,
         depending on the position you are gunning for. <br>
         Let’s look at a couple of examples:</p><br>
         <h3>Qualifications for a Software Engineer</h3><br>
        <p>
            ✨ Experience coding in C/C++, and Python for system software development<br>
            ✨ Experience in developing multi-threaded applications on Embedded Linux environments<br>
            ✨ Communication, troubleshooting, and analytical experience<br>
            ✨ Good-to-have:<br>
            ✨ Familiarity with Linux kernel, IPC, and device driver model<br>
            ✨ Familiarity with various hardware elements of the latest data center environments<br>
            ✨ Familiarity with embedded systems software stack<br>
        </p><br>
        <h3>Qualifications for a Developer Support Engineer</h3><br>
        <p>
            ⭐ 3+ years of experience in software development<br>

            ⭐ Communication skills in English<br>
            ⭐ Demonstrated creative problem-solving approach and great investigation skills<br>
            ⭐ Good-to-have: Experience developing for mobile<br>
        </p><br>
        <h2>How Do I Make My Resume Stand Out?</h2><br>
        <p>So, you’ve got what it takes to apply for the role — but how do you convey this to the recruiter? With your resume, of course!
             Here are some tips to help you improve your chances of being shortlisted for a Facebook interview:</p><br>
        <h3>Keep It Short and Relevant</h3><br>
        <p>Recruiters are swamped with thousands of resumes — a shorter resume means they can read through it quicker. Some say your resume should be a one-pager,
             but that would be tricky if you have a few years of experience. Here’s what you can do:</p><br>
        <p>
            1. Study the job description of the role you’re applying for<br>
            2. Make a note of the keywords they’ve used and the experience they require<br>
            3. Customize your resume to match those keywords and experience; remove irrelevant things<br>
            4. When writing about your work experience, use no more than five bullet points<br>
        </p><br>
       <h2> What’s the Facebook Interview Process Like?</h2><br>
       <p>We’ve collated experiences of current and former Facebook employees and studied Facebook’s 
           career website and articles to bring you an outline of the software engineer interview process at Facebook:</p><br>
           <h3>Round 1: Technical Screening</h3><br>
           <p>This round starts with the interviewer or panelists introducing themselves and explaining their role at Facebook. After that, the focus shifts to you. 
               You can expect a 5- to 10-minute conversation around your work experience and career aspirations. </p><br>
        <p>Then comes the tech bit — the test of your knowledge of data structures and algorithms.</p><br>
        <p>You will be given one or more coding questions, which you should solve and explain in 10 to 30 minutes. Here, the interviewer will gauge your problem-solving skills.
             As you’re answering, they may tweak the questions or add more questions to test the depth of your knowledge.</p><br>
             <p><b>In the case of remote interviews, you will code on an online collaborative editor. 
                 In-person interviews are trickier, as you would need to write the code on a whiteboard.</b></p><br>
        <h3>Round 2: On-site Interview</h3><br>
        <p>The on-site interview is about an hour-and-a-half long and has a couple of sub-rounds:<br>
            1. <b>Coding interview (45 minutes):</b> This coding interview will be tougher than the initial screening interview — the questions will be more challenging and the evaluation process more rigorous.
             You can expect one or more coding problems in this round.<br>
             2. <b>Design interview (45 minutes):</b> There are two types of design interviews:<br>
             3. <b>System design interview:</b> First, you will be asked details about systems you have designed in the past and your approach.
              Then, you will be asked to design a system from scratch.For example, “How would you architect the backend for a messaging system?”<br>
            4.<b>Product design interview:</b> Here too, the products you’ve designed will be discussed first. After that, you will be asked to solve a product design problem
                For example, “How would you design an email server?” or “How would you design a client-server API to build a rich document editor?”<br>
            </p><br>
            <h2>Round 3: Behavioral Interview</h2><br>
            <p>
                Here, the interviewer will assess whether you are a good fit for Facebook. 
                The discussion will revolve around your previous work experience, with a focus on the behavioral aspects. For example, 
                how you dealt with various challenges. <br><br>

There will also be questions about what motivates you to work at Facebook. <br><br>

If you thought you’re done with coding questions, think again! Even the behavioral round features coding questions. 
However, it will be a quicker version of the initial coding interview. <br>
            </p><br>
            <h2>Facebook Technical Interview Question Examples</h2><br>
            <p>⭐ Longest increasing subsequence: You have to find the longest increasing subsequence of a given array of integers<br><br>
                ⭐ Unique paths in a grid: <br><br>
                ⭐ You are given a grid of size m×n<br><br>
                ⭐ You must start at (1,1) and your goal is to reach (m,n)<br><br>
                ⭐ At any instance, if you are on (x,y), you can either go to (x, y + 1) or (x + 1, y)<br><br>
                ⭐ However, there can be obstacles in your path, which you cannot move to
                (1 = obstacle, 0 = empty space)<br><br>
                ⭐ How many unique paths would there be?<br><br>
                ⭐ Ways to decode: A message with letters from A to Z is encoded to numbers using the following mapping: A = 1, B = 2, …, Z = 26. For a given encoded message,
                you must determine the total number of ways to decode it.<br><br>
                ⭐ Best time to buy and sell stocks: You are given an array in which the <br>“i”th element is the price of a given stock on day i.<br><br> 
                ⭐ Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.<br><br>
                ⭐ Regular expression match: <br><br>
                ⭐ You are given a “text” and a “wildcard pattern" <br><br>
                ⭐ You must implement an algorithm that shows whether or not the pattern matches the text (it should be a complete match, not partial)<br><br></p><br>
